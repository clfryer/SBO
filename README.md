Shock Breakout Code:  O# (O4939)

This code assumes a distribution of ejecta velocities and then calculates the emission as a function of time for the velocities including relativistic corrections.  
Many of the parameters are hard coded - my hope is that we make this less so with time.

This code requires an opacity file - we include an open data file from Colgan, J., Kilcrease, D. P., Magee, N. H., et al. 2016, ApJ,
817, 116, doi: 10.3847/0004-637X/817/2/116
